open a terminal and go to your catkn workspace's source directory:
```
cd ${catkin_ws}/src
```
then clone the 'gazebo_utils' repo from github:
```
git clone ${github_url}
```
build your catkin workspace with:
```
catkin build
```
NOTE:please do not build your catkin workspace with **catkin_make**!!!.




NOTE:if you get some errors like **[rospack] Error: package 'some' not found** that is because you don't build your ROS package.
